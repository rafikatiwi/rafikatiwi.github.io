This is a project of redesigning a Financial Management and Investment App when I worked at <a href='http://www.flolab.co/fundtastic'>Flolab</a> (UX Design Agency based in Jakarta, Indonesia) as a UX Designer along with other UI/UX Designers. My role was working on sketching the wireframe for Mutual Fund, Investment Portfolio, and Smart Wallet and working on creating the user flow / states for each features. 

In this project, we redesigned several features of the existing application, such as:
1. Mutual Fund & Registration (using e-KYC)
2. Gold store & its payment page
3. Investment portfolio page
4. Smart Wallet (budget management)

The flow:
1. Mutual Fund & Registration
