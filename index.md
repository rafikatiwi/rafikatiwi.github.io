## Hi there, my name is Rafika.

I'm a final semester master's student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) majoring in [Knowledge Service Engineering](https://kse.kaist.ac.kr/) and a member of [KIRC](http://kirc.kaist.ac.kr/) lab. My research interest lies in the fields of HCI, especially in Human - Conversational Agents / Intelligent Agents interaction focusing on addressing social issues that arise within the interaction. I am also interested in applying Data Science to analyze user behavior and to answer questions related to user's interaction with a product. 

I am currently looking for Conversational UX Designer or Data Scientist position opportunities. Feel free to contact me if there is anything you would like to discuss!
