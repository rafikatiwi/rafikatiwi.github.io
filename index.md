## Hi there, my name is Rafika.

I'm currently a master's student at KAIST majoring in Knowledge Service Engineering and a member of [KIRC](http://kirc.kaist.ac.kr/) lab. My interests lie in the fields of HCI, especially in Human-Artificial Intelligence interaction, and Data Science. I am currently working on my graduate thesis in human's acceptability of a Conversational Agent and working on Big Data projects at [Daewoong Foundation](http://http://daewoongfoundation.or.kr/)
